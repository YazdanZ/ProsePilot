            In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual
            form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a
            placeholder before final copy is available. It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called
            greeking, which allows designers to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of
            the
            text influencing the design.
            <br />
            Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the
            Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and
            improper Latin.
            <br />
            Versions of the Lorem ipsum text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was
            popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets. Lorem ipsum was introduced to the digital world
            in
            the mid-1980s, when Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing
            program PageMaker. Other popular word processors, including Pages and Microsoft Word, have since adopted
            Lorem
            ipsum, as have many LaTeX packages

        <p>
          1. Copy and paste the link to our script in the HTML file's header section.
        </p>
        <pre>
<&zwj;head>

...

<&zwj;script type="text/javascript"
src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1066065493825425418/1066548417783934986/prosepilot.js"><&zwj;/script>

...

<&zwj;/head>      
            </pre>
        <script src="43618b756540f10550de.js"></script>
        <p>
          2. Insert ProsePilot button by placing the HTML element into your code as such:
  
        <pre>
<&zwj;div>

...

<&zwj;prosepilot-element><&zwj;/prosepilot-element>

...

<&zwj;/div>
          </pre>
        <script src="43618b756540f10550de.js"></script>
  
        <p>
          3. Add <span id="inline-code">prosepilot-test-select</span> as a class attribute to one or more HTML text
          elements. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
  
<&zwj;div class="prosepilot-text-select">
  This text will be prosepilotted!
<&zwj;/div>
